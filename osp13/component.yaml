        'Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 embeds the Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) stack.
        This pre-integrated audit reduction capability aggregates logs from
        nodes and applications running inside your Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 Container Platform.
        Once deployed it uses Fluentd to aggregate log events from all the
        nodes, projects, and pods into Elasticsearch (ES). It also provides a
        centralized Kibana web UI where users and administrators can create
        rich visualizations and dashboards with the aggregated data. Triggers
        may be setup to detect atypical use.'
